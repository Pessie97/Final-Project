		<br><br><p id="start">The front crawl consists of many aspects. 
			The arm motion, head motion and leg motion, breathing and body roll. 
			</p>
		
		<ol>
			
				<li id="postion">First, we will begin with the body position. Our body must be in a perfectly streamlined position. 
				Everything is completely relaxed, and stretched out as far as we can reach, with our fingers 
				and toes. Our toes are pointed to the opposite side and our fingers are reaching 
				out all the way in front. Our head should be looking down, towards the floor of the pool 
				for the duration of the stroke. <br>
				<a id="picture"><img src = "https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8e/Swim-the-Breaststroke-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/aid25773-v4-900px-Swim-the-Breaststroke-Step-3-Version-5.jpg"></a>
				<div id="dialog" title="Front Crawl" style="display: none;">
					The front crawl must begin with a perfectly stream-lined position.
				</div>
				</li>
				
			
				<li id="feet">
				Next, we will kick our feet really hard without splashing the water. Let your kick come from your hips, 
				not your knees. Try to stick you upper legs together, and not bend your knees. That is harder than it sounds. 
				Once you can do that, you can relax your legs and let them natrually find where they belong. 
				Can you try that? It seems to be difficult but once you try, you will see its not really as difficult as 
				it seems. <br>

				<a href="https://youtu.be/W3IWUwFE_20">Here is a link to a video</a>
				</li>
				
				<li id="arms">
					Now for the best part, your arms... :) Relax your hands, arms, and wrists. You want your hands and 
					fingers and wrists to be 
					<em>"floppy"</em>. Your arm will enter the water finger tips first. Following that, the rest of your 
					arm will follow. The whole time, the elbow <strong>MUST</strong> be higher than the rest of your arm. Your elbow 
					enters the water last. As soon as everything but your elbow is in the water, start to straighten 
					your arm. When your elbow enters the water, your arm should be completely straight. 
					This is a constant motion, meant to propel you forward.<br>

				</li>
				
				<li id="breath">Now for the breathing... Your face is submerged in the water up to your ears. The whole time you should be looking 
					toward the floor. When you need to breathe, your face should turn to the side, towards 
					the arm that you write with. If you are a righty, your face will turn to the right. 
					If you are a lefty, your face should turn to the left. 
					When your face comes out of the water, your head should be turned in such a way that only 
					your ear in still in the water. Your cheek will be resting on the water and your eyes 
					should be looking at the shoulder towards which you turned. As soon as your mouth cleared the water, 
					open really wide, breathe in and then turn your face back into the water. <br>
